# Mines

Mines is a classic Minesweeper game where the player navigates through a board covered with tiles to avoid hidden mines and reveal safe squares.

## Game Overview

The game is played on a rectangular board covered with square tiles, some of which hide mines while the rest are safe. The objective is to reveal all safe tiles without uncovering any mines.

## How to Play
On each turn, click on a tile to reveal it.
  - If you reveal a mine, you lose.
